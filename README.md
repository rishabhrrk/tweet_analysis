# Tweet Analysis

## Created By: Rishabh Khanna

This repository consists of a single scala file.

The code in the file can be used to extract tweets based on a keyword,
which can be mentioned instead of Rajasthan. A list can also be given

(var seq:Seq[String] = Seq("#Rajasthan")).

For the file to run another file containing details of Twitter API is required.

The file can be named as twitter.txt
